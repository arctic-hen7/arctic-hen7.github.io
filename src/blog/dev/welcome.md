Welcome to the Dev category of my blog!

This category will be used to document my journeys in programming, across all the languages I use! As of August 2021, I'm mostly working with Rust (if you haven't, try it!), but I've worked extensively with JavaScript in the past, and I'll probably document some JS stuff here too!
