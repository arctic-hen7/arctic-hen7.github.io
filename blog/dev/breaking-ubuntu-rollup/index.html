        <article class="styled-prose">
            <p>This post details one of the strangest failures I've ever seen in Ubuntu and how to fix it. For me, this occurred after deleting <code>rollup</code>, but it may have been something else for you! Please leave a comment if you've had this problem and if you have any idea how it works!</p>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>I was working on <a href="https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus">Perseus</a> this morning, specifically removing the dependency on <a href="">Rollup</a> for the project. So, I naturally decided to remove Rollup completely from my system to test that there was no longer any dependency.</p>
<p>So, I did what made sense; <code>yarn global remove rollup</code>. And, to my dismay, <code>rollup</code> still worked as a command. I ran <code>which rollup</code> to find the exact location of the binary, which was in <code>~/.yarn/bin</code>. And then I did what you should <strong>never</strong> do. I decided to delete is manually with <code>rm</code>.</p>
<p>Now it's worth noting that around this time my system had become very slow due to some kind of swap glitch, and so I decided to restart, having just deleted a binary manually. Now it's worth noting that I installed <code>rollup</code> through <code>yarn</code>, which I installed through <code>npm</code>, which I installed through <code>nvm</code> (Node version manager), which I installed with <code>curl</code>. That's <em>five</em> degrees of separation from anything that should be remotely system-critical, hence my confusion at what happened next.</p>
<p>So, booting my computer back up, everything was working as normal. I got to the login screen fine, the fan still whirring a bit from the swap glitch, and I typed in my password as usual. Then, as my desktop loaded, my mouse froze. I could not interact with my system in any way whatsoever. I rebooted <em>three</em> times, the exact same thing.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>My first thought was to change my login shell, which is <code>fish</code>, to something more mainstream like <code>bash</code>, as that could have some <code>rollup</code> dependency that might be causing a system hang. I did that with recovery mode, which I'll explain now (you'll need this), but to no avail.</p>
<h3>Ubuntu Recovery Mode</h3>
<p>Ubuntu has a very helpful boot mode called recovery mode that you can use to repair a broken system. You'll need to be able to boot your system for this, which was fine for me because it was a post-login issue.</p>
<p>You can access recovery mode by spamming <code>Esc</code> as your computer boots to stop UEFI fast boot, and then press <code>Enter</code> to continue boot. Immediately after that, hold down <code>Shift</code> (don't spam it) to get the GRUB menu, the bootloader. Then go down to something like <code>Advanced Options</code>, and then select <code>Recovery Mode</code> with the newest kernel (for this issue at least, but this can also be used to revert broken kernel upgrades). You should now be taken to a terminal-only screen (where you'll need to decrypt your hard drive and the like), and then you'll get a menu of options. This will boot your filesystem read-only, so it's practically impossible to do any damage without changing that, which you can do in 20.04 and later by selecting <code>Enable networking</code> and pressing <code>Enter</code>. Then press the option that lets you drop into a root shell, and you now have a root terminal on your system!</p>
<p><em>Aside: THIS is why you should encrypt your hard drive! Otherwise, yeah, anyone could use this to do <a href="https://r3xnation.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/how-to-hack-into-ubuntuany-version/">anything they want</a> (weird link but good explanation) to your system.</em></p>
<h3>Actually Fixing It</h3>
<p>After logging into a hung desktop with 10 minutes until I was needed on a Zoom meeting, I booted back into recovery mode, enabled networking, and switched to my user account with <code>su arctic_hen7</code>. I confirmed that <code>rollup</code> didn't exist, and then found that <code>yarn</code> didn't either. That was weird, and neither did <code>node</code>! In case you're thinking of weird <code>fish</code> stuff with loading custom binaries, I was in <code>bash</code> at this point. I still have no idea how deleting a binary manually managed to corrupt the entire JavaScript stack on my computer.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I reinstalled Node using <a href="">NVM</a> (which I already had installed), reinstalled <code>yarn</code>, and then ran <code>yarn global add rollup</code> for good measure. I then tried popping into <code>fish</code> to see how it was going. I use <code>fish</code> with <a href="">Starship</a>, and it was telling me that the latter wasn't working. Two minutes until that Zoom meeting by the way.</p>
<p>I frantically rebooted and crossed my fingers, noting that my shell was still set to <code>bash</code> in case Starship was still an issue. And it worked! Until a spontaneous logout 12 minutes later, which I think was unrelated, because it didn't happen again and still hasn't yet (I am so expecting one as a write this...).</p>
<p>After my Zoom meeting, I then tried using <code>fish</code> again: errors were gone. I assume Starship was trying to do something that's not allowed in recovery mode, but I can't yet remember the error message, so I have no idea what.</p>
<h2>Closing Words</h2>
<p>So, that was one of the weirdest issues I've ever encountered in all my time using Linux, but thankfully it was a pretty easy fix. I have still found no documentation online about this, so hopefully this helps someone at some point in the future!</p>
<p>Also, if you've had this issue, please let me know in the comments!</p>
<p>Oh, and the lesson from all this is to <strong>NEVER MANUALLY DELETE BINARIES!!!</strong></p>
