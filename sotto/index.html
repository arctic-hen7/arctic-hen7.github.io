<h1 id="sotto">Sotto</h1>
<p>Sotto is an app for the blind and visually-impaired that allows writing and editing <em>longform documents</em> using purely the voice. It's currently in development, with planned support for these key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely high-fidelity dictation performed on-device (no servers, you own your data)</li>
<li>Support for dozens of languages</li>
<li>Fine-grained editing through a visual-impairment-friendly keyboard input method and voice-controlled editing (e.g. &quot;replace albatross with aardvark&quot;)</li>
<li>Automatic talkback for a no-sight-required interface</li>
<li>Large-scale document editing with AI (e.g. &quot;use double-spacing throughout the document&quot;)</li>
<li>Inbuilt document and section storage with search designed for working with long documents and shorter fragments alike</li>
<li>Import/export support for all common formats</li>
<li>PDF annotation support</li>
<li>Third-party app integration through AI (e.g. &quot;send this as an email to John&quot;)</li>
<li>Extremely fast</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our mission:</strong> Enable the visually-impaired to use computers to write and edit documents just like the rest of us, without being forced to have others edit their work for them, and without being beholden to poor-quality dictation systems.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>Sotto will be a paid app with a limited free tier, to maximise access to high-quality document editing for the visually impaired across the world. Right now, a limited prototype exists, and further information is being gathered from potential users to understand which features to prioritise.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-help">How can I help?</h2>
<p>The best thing you can do right now is to share information about Sotto with anyone you know who might find it helpful, especially those suffering from visual impairments who want to be able to write longer documents, be they academic papers, blog posts, memoirs, or anything else that requires more than a cursory pass of editing. If you yourself are visually impaired, we would greatly appreciate your taking the time to fill out <a href="https://airtable.com/appZaSzaeT2dSinKb/pagh4Qclacy6hbv7e/form">this survey</a> if possible, so we can better understand your needs. The main developer of this application is not visually impaired, so we need all the help we can get in understanding what works and what doesn't.</p>
<p>Additionally, we're actively seeking to build a business around selling this software so we can make development self-sustaining; we want to build something to last that will be continually updated, not something that's going to fizzle out in a few months. As such, joining our mailing list is one of the most helpful things you can do: not only does that give us a place to update you on developments, it also gives us a way to gauge how much interest there is in Sotto.
