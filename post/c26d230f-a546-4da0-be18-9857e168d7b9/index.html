Problem solving can be hard, but it&rsquo;s extremely rewarding. Implementing code is generally great, except that it inevitably generates problems for you to solve, but that&rsquo;s part of the joy!\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nIn this post though, I want to focus on the third type of work we do &#x2013; mundane, repetitive tasks. This could be anything, like a long build command, typing the same sequence of commands over and over again, or banging your head against a wall when you try to read your own code six months later.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nBonnie is a tool I built a few months ago as my first ever project in <a href=\\"https://rust-lang.org\\">Rust</a>, and since then I&rsquo;ve made significant updates that have improved every facet of it. It was originally intended as a replacement for NPM scripts, the simple little command aliasing system many JavaScript developers will be familiar with. Problem is, Rust doesn&rsquo;t have that, nor do a lot of languages! Bonnie was designed to be a cross-platform system to enable command aliasing in any project, regardless of programming language!\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nToday, Bonnie supports custom arguments to scripts, environment variable interpolation, subcommands, conditional command ordering, and so much more!\\n</p>\\n\\n<div id=\\"outline-container-org4e2ea6a\\" class=\\"outline-2\\">\\n<h2 id=\\"org4e2ea6a\\">Installing</h2>\\n<div class=\\"outline-text-2\\" id=\\"text-org4e2ea6a\\">\\n<p>\\nBonnie has pre-built binaries for Linux (and musl), MacOS, and Windows, which you can download from <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/bonnie/releases\\">here</a>. After downloading the right one, put it in a directory from which you can execute scripts, like <code>/usr/local/bin</code> on Linux.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nIf you&rsquo;re using Docker or a platform for which there&rsquo;s not a pre-built binary, check out the installation instructions on the homepage <a href=\\"https://github.com/arctic-hen7/bonnie\\">here</a>.
