So, I naturally decided to remove Rollup completely from my system to test that there was no longer any dependency.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nSo, I did what made sense; <code>yarn global remove rollup</code>. And, to my dismay, <code>rollup</code> still worked as a command. I ran <code>which rollup</code> to find the exact location of the binary, which was in <code>~/.yarn/bin</code>. And then I did what you should <i>never</i> do. I decided to delete is manually with <code>rm</code>.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nNow it&rsquo;s worth noting that around this time my system had become very slow due to some kind of swap glitch, and so I decided to restart, having just deleted a binary manually. Now it&rsquo;s worth noting that I installed <code>rollup</code> through <code>yarn</code>, which I installed through <code>npm</code>, which I installed through <code>nvm</code> (Node version manager), which I installed with <code>curl</code>. That&rsquo;s <b>five</b> degrees of separation from anything that should be remotely system-critical, hence my confusion at what happened next.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nSo, booting my computer back up, everything was working as normal. I got to the login screen fine, the fan still whirring a bit from the swap glitch, and I typed in my password as usual. Then, as my desktop loaded, my mouse froze. I could not interact with my system in any way whatsoever. I rebooted <b>three</b> times, the exact same thing.\\n</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<div id=\\"outline-container-org33c099d\\" class=\\"outline-2\\">\\n<h2 id=\\"org33c099d\\">The Solution</h2>\\n<div class=\\"outline-text-2\\" id=\\"text-org33c099d\\">\\n<p>\\nMy first thought was to change my login shell, which is <code>fish</code>, to something more mainstream like <code>bash</code>, as that could have some <code>rollup</code> dependency that might be causing a system hang.

You&rsquo;ll need to be able to boot your system for this, which was fine for me because it was a post-login issue.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nYou can access recovery mode by spamming <code>Esc</code> as your computer boots to stop UEFI fast boot, and then press <code>Enter</code> to continue boot. Immediately after that, hold down <code>Shift</code> (don&rsquo;t spam it) to get the GRUB menu, the bootloader. Then go down to something like <code>Advanced Options</code>, and then select <code>Recovery Mode</code> with the newest kernel (for this issue at least, but this can also be used to revert broken kernel upgrades). You should now be taken to a terminal-only screen (where you&rsquo;ll need to decrypt your hard drive and the like), and then you&rsquo;ll get a menu of options. This will boot your filesystem read-only, so it&rsquo;s practically impossible to do any damage without changing that, which you can do in 20.04 and later by selecting <code>Enable networking</code> and pressing <code>Enter</code>. Then press the option that lets you drop into a root shell, and you now have a root terminal on your system!\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n<i>Aside: THIS is why you should encrypt your hard drive!

In case you&rsquo;re thinking of weird <code>fish</code> stuff with loading custom binaries, I was in <code>bash</code> at this point.
