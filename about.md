Hey there! I'm ***Sam Brew*** (*arctic-hen7*), a **fullstack web developer**, **distributed systems designer**, and budding **economist**! This is my personal website, made with [Perseus](https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US), a framework I created, and populated with [various thoughts](posts) that I've written up at various times. I am currently a first-year undergraduate student of [Economics/Computer Science](https://www.unsw.edu.au/study/undergraduate/bachelor-of-economics-computer-science) at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, and I am also a classical tenor and a flautist.

I work mostly with Rust in terms of programming, though I'm fluent in JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS/etc., Bash, C/C++, and plenty of others I've touched at some stage over the last few years. I've been programming since I was about eight, working on various different projects, most of which have ended up as zip files on an old hard drive. A few of my notable projects are [Perseus](https://github.com/framesurge/perseus) (a Rust web development framework), [Lykros](https://github.com/TheQuantorium/lykros) (a general cryptographic data protection system that provides fine-grained access control and extreme security for databases), [Kolaris](https://github.com/TheQuantorium/kolaris) (a distributed storage and computation platform), and [Miriar](https://github.com/TheQuantorium/miriar).

I'm also the founder of [*Framesurge*](https://github.com/framesurge), an organisation devoted to building frameworks and general solutions to complex problems in tech (whcih currently stewards Perseus, along with some other projects), and [*The Quantorium*](https://quantorium.org), an organisation building the platforms for the next generation of decentralisation, beyond both blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Most of my projects have their own contact mechanisms, most through GitHub (including my academic work, as I'm a strong believer in open academia), though, if you'd like to contact me directly about a collaboration, opportunity, or anything else, you can reach me at [arctic.hen@pm.me](mailto:arctic.hen@pm.me).
