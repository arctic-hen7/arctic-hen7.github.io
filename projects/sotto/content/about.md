# About Us

Across this website, you'll see references to "us", and "our team", which is a bit of wishful thinking! Right now, Sotto is being developed by [me](https://github.com/arctic-hen7), an undergraduate computer science student with a passion for solving problems through technology.

My grandfather is one of the most extraordinary people I know, a doctor whose devotion to palliative care --- the treatment of those nearing the end of their lives --- is matched only by his care and love for everyone he meets. Yet, as he has aged himself, he has developed [macular degeneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration), a condition where sight breaks down rapidly, leading to partial, unfocused vision. In his case, he sees out of a sliver of one eye, with no ability to focus or perceive anything other than shapes or colours. And yet, he was resolved to write his memoirs, which have, over the past ten years, turned out to be a 600-page tome of knowledge and insight into medicine, family, and the times he has lived through.

As every year passed, that book became harder and harder to write, and now, forever afflicted by "that's not quite right"-itis, my grandfather wants to edit his memoirs. With the ever-faithful support of my grandmother, he can begin to do that. However, I couldn't help but wonder why there wasn't a better solution, a way for my grandfather to have his memoirs read to him and to edit them just using his voice. If you can edit in collaboration with a person who can see, why can't you edit in collaboration with a computer that can see? This was how Sotto was born, in early 2023.

Over the course of that year, I built two prototypes, and now I'm extending the second into a fully-featured app with proper editing support that uses AI to facilitate genuinely conversational editing. When complete, you should be able to talk to the app, to have it rewrite sentences, add new sections, and anything else. With a fully-integrated experience, you should never have to leave Sotto to edit your documents, and, with eventual third-party app integration planned, you should be able to export your documents with a single utterance into whatever context they're needed in.

I have a lot of other commitments, to learning, to family, and to other projects too, but this is something I'm deeply passionate about building. With [your support](@/_index.md#how-can-i-help), I hope to make Sotto a reality, for my grandfather, for the 200mn people around the world who suffer from the same condition as him, and for the nearly one billion people with a significant visual impairment.
